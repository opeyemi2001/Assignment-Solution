        <section id=r1><p class="title1"><strong>Chicken</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Chicken is a delicious food enjoyed by many.</br>
            Chicken is so interwoven into our lives that people eat it for every occasion. 
            Chicken dishes are some of the most delicious and widely-consumed meals out there.
            </br>
            Do you eat chicken because you are familiar with the scientific literature on them and have decided that their suffering doesn't matter, 
            or do you do it because it tastes good?

        <section id=r2><p class="title2"><strong>Beef</strong></p>
            <p class="content">The American fast food diet and the meat eating habits of the wealthy around the world support a world food system that diverts food resources from the hungry. 
                A diet higher in whole grains and legumes and lower in beef and other meat is not just healthier for ourselves but also contributes to changing
                the world system that feeds some people and leaves others hungry.</p>

        <section id=r3><p class="title3"><strong>Sushi</strong></p>
            <p class="content">Sushi is an oriental staple that has tremendous historical and cultural significance. For some people, it’s a natural food that provides a sublime culinary experience and pleasure. 
                But for others, it’s an eccentric food that is not really easy to get acquainted with.
            Nevertheless, sushi is the kind of food that makes you fall madly in love with it (to the point that you no longer want to live life without it) after you get familiar with it.
